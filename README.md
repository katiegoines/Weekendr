### Approach

Starting this project was difficult. Maybe it's the fatigue, or maybe I just suck at ideation, but I really struggled to come up with an idea that would showcase use of React functionality, lend itself to an aeshetically pleasing app, and be sort of interesting. I'm not sure that it's interesting, and it's not as usefull as initially intended, because additional APIs I would have liked to use were subscription based, and, frankly, $220/month is just too much for this project right now...

So my approach on this was a little backwards. By the time I settled in an acceptable idea, I felt frazzled and jumped in, rather than taking the time to plan everything out from the get-go. I was still reasearching APIs but didn't want to waste too much time on planning when I wasn't completely sure what I was doing.

After a day of initial setup, I built out wireframes (see below) and preliminary user stories. These are, admittedly, not my best work, but can be found on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/HsUq1csv/project-4). As I work to improve this project, I will begin by building out comprehensive user stories.

### Installation/Startup Instructions

- Fork and clone the repository from Github to a local directory

- Open up the project directory in terminal and run `npm install` to install any npm packages needed

- In the project folder, run `mongod` and `nodemon`.

- In the client folder, run `npm start` to start a server for the React app.

  ​

### Unresolved Issues

The design isn't fully responsive. It's kinda-sorta, but it needs work for sure.



### Future Features and Functionality

Additional features and functionality that are intended to be built into this app in the future are:

- Additonal APIs to provide information on: 1) crime data, 2) cost of living data, 3) events, 4) public transportation options.

- I'd like registered users to be able to do more when they're logged in, maybe: 1) save a packing to do list, 2) search for movers in the area they currently live in, 3) get moving tips
